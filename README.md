**Coffee Shop Sales Analysis** 

**About the Dataset:** 

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Maven Analytics and pertains to Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop chain operating across three locations in New York City. The dataset includes transaction records with details such as transaction date, timestamp, store location, and product-level specifics. 

**Data Preview:** 

- **transaction\_id:** A unique sequential ID representing an individual transaction. 
- **transaction\_date**: The date of the transaction (MM/DD/YY). 
- **transaction\_time:** The timestamp of the transaction (HH:MM). 
- **transaction\_qty:** The quantity of items sold. 
- **store\_id:** A unique ID representing the coffee shop where the transaction took place. 
- **store\_location:** The location of the coffee shop where the transaction took place. 
- **product\_id:** A unique ID representing the product sold. 
- **unit\_price**: The retail price of the product sold. 
- **product\_category:** A description of the product category. 
- **product\_type**: A description of the product type. 
- **product\_detail**: A description of the product detail. 

**Data Cleaning Steps:** 

1. **Product Details and Size Separation**: 
- The product\_detail field initially contained both the product description and the size of the product. These were separated into two distinct fields, product\_description and product\_size, to enhance data clarity and enable more detailed analysis. 
2. **Trimming Whitespace from Product Size:** 
- The product\_size field contained leading and trailing spaces, which were removed to ensure data consistency and accuracy during further analysis. 
3. **Extraction of Transaction Time**: 
- The transaction\_time field included an arbitrary date along with the time of the transaction. Since only the time was relevant for the analysis, the date portion was removed, retaining only the time in the transaction\_time field. 
4. **Separation of Month and Day from Date:** 
- To facilitate time-based analysis, the original transaction\_date field was split into separate month and day fields. This allows for a more detailed examination of trends and patterns based on specific months and days.
